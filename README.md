After you sign up or log in, you will see three buttons: Enter Room, Choose Public, and Create Room.

## Create Room

You can be a host and create a public or private room. After creating the room, you will wait for another player to join the room. When a player joins the room, you will be directed to their room where they can choose/take a photo and start swapping it.

## Enter Room / Choose Public

You can also join a private room or a public room. When you click **Enter Room**, you will need to enter the private room's name to join the room. If you click **Choose Public**, you can enter one of the rooms that are listed.

## Choose Photo and Swap

When two players are in the room, you will be asked to take photo or choose a photo from your album. After a photo is chosen, **swap** it and wait for another player to click **swap**. Once you receive the other player's photo, you both can start decorating the photo with emojis and keep swapping it until you are done. Click **Save** and the photo will be downloaded to your phone.

## Leave Room

If the other player leaves the room, you will see a message saying "The other user left", and you can no longer swap. You will be directed to the home page where you can create room or enter a room when you leave.
